# Notes on how Andy likes to set up his personal macOS systems

Put Dock at left side of screen.

Icons that I keep in the dock, from top to bottom:

+ Finder
+ Siri (macOS 10.14)
+ Launchpad
+ Activity Monitor, with CPU history shown in dock icon
+ App Store
+ Screen Sharing
+ Firefox
+ Google Chrome
+ Safari
+ VirtualBox
+ Terminal
+ Emacs
+ OmniGraffle
+ Notes
+ Messages

Top right of menu bar at top of screen:

+ iStat menus showing CPU, MEM, SSD, Network, Sensors
+ DropBox (when it was free to use)
+ ClamXAV
+ Default Folder X
+ Karabiner Elements (see below)
+ Caffeine
+ WiFi
+ Day of week & Time in HH:MM:SS A/PM format
  + TODO: How to configure it this way in macOS 11?
+ Spotlight
+ Notifications

Login Items:

+ Activity Monitor
+ Caffeine
+ DropBox (when it was free to use)
+ Default Folder X
+ Karabiner-Elements (see below)


# Karabiner Elements

Karabiner-Elements settings were only these, so I am not sure whether
it is worth installing Karabiner-Elements only for this, especially
since the caps_lock -> left_control I can configure in System
Preferences->Keyboard already:

+ caps_lock -> left_control
+ right_option -> right_control
